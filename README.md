# AccessibilityName
Problem with accessibility name for Label in Android. If you set the accessibility name of an empty label with 'AutomationProperties.SetName(label, "Test accessibility name")' in the UI these accessible text is shown, and it shouldn't. The native command 'ContentDescription' doesn't show the text setted.
